# MSU Scripter 5.0.0

Release 5.0.0 introduces some major overhauls to the MSU Scripter in order to make the experience better for users.

## Updated UI

The UI has been completely redesigned to allow you to make things easier and more streamlined.

### Main Starting Window

The main starting window has been redone to have tabs for the creating new projects, opening projects, and changing settings.
The first time launching, it will default to the new project tab, which now allows you to populate additional fields before creating the MSU project than before. 
When launching the MSU Scripter after creating a project, it will default to the open project tab.

### MSU Project Window

After opening a project, the list of all tracks and songs is now displayed on the left. 
Using this left panel, you can select the track you want to view, add songs to tracks, and even move songs around between different tracks.
You can easily search for specific tracks as well as customize the view to show additional icons to easily see the status of the project.

### Basic vs Advanced Song Views

When editing the details of a song, you can choose to either use the basic view with integrated PyMusicLooper that will only show the most commonly edited fields,
or you can use the advanced view which has all MsuPcm++ fields accessible. The advanced view has a panel similar to the track panel that allows you to add, copy,
and move sub tracks and sub channels easily. By default the MSU Scripter will ask each time which view you want to use, but you can select a default view if desired.

The buttons for playing the song and the audio controls are now always accessible at the bottom when viewing a song as well.
